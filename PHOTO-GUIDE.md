## What You Need to Do

Export photos from Apple Photos and save them to the **photos** folder (the one sitting next to the HTML file).

## How to Export from Photos

1. **Select the photos** you want in Photos app
2. **File > Export > Export [number] Photos**
3. **Choose the photos folder** (the one next to for-you-quietly.html)
4. **Rename them** using the simple names above

That's it! Once the photos are in place, open the HTML file in a browser.

## What I Built

**Full-screen immersive storytelling** — each image, text section, and keepsake takes up the whole screen. You scroll through the story one beat at a time:

- Full-screen image
- Text card with date/title/quote
- Another full-screen image
- Keepsake card (voice memo, email)
- Next moment...

**Keepsakes are interspaced** throughout as breathing room — not at the end. Things like:
- The voice note after Abuja
- Message excerpts after "Proof of life"
- The coupon email + "Hey Dami..." email after that section
- The first email + RSVP after "The emails start"

You can add the actual content for these keepsakes later (I left placeholders).
